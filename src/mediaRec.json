The sequel is good too, if you’re craving some more cozy hamster adventures.",

There’s a level where you’re on a flying platform blowing up a naval ship with a handgun. One of the bosses is game of King of the Hill against a giant mech dog. The final boss you actually get a mech of your own, only now you’re the middleman in a battle between the terrestrial body Earth and his evil twin brother, Earth Mimicry. This game is sick. There’s a story tying all this cool shit together, but it’s completely incomprehensible. I have no idea what this game is about. I really don’t care though. I’m honestly just grateful it’s letting my hang out with it. The controls kinda hurt my hands. I’ve never had to hold the N64 controller the way this game makes me. It’s awesome. This game is completely unique to itself. There’s truly nothing like it. Please play it.            ",

Your job in the game is do Roomba stuff like cleaning up trash, but you end up becoming really tight with the family that owns you and all the toys in the house, and solving like four “will-they-won't-they” conflicts. It rules. There’s really something pure and beautiful about this game. It’s just all about love and serving others. Also it’s just really good feeling. The soundtrack is groovy and relaxing, and the art direction is charming as hell. It’s the only game to ever make me cry, and I’ve played Cubivore. Play this game if you like things that are good.",

            "desc":"Two Sisters is a shameless trick designed to trap children into watching endlessly for a fortune of YouTube ad revenue. Its salacious thumbnails promise unsupervised children wild stories of mystery, romance and comedy starring Anna, Elsa and the rest of the Frozen gang. It absolutely delivers. Episode 15 to 18 of Two Sisters is the brief saga where Prince Eric of Little Mermaid fame shows up to the Two Sisters Castle and gets caught in an inevitable love triangle between Jack Frost and Princess Elsa (one of the two titular sisters).  I don’t have the time or space to go into finer details about the Halloween party it takes place during or where it fits in with the greater narrative of Evil Elsa’s scheme to defeat Normal Elsa, but ultimately it ends with Prince Eric sacrificing himself to protect Elsa from a blast of dark energy. In his dying breath Eric whispers goodbye to Elsa, before transforming into a frog, doing a jig, and vanishing in a puff of smoke. It’s an incredible story that's conclusion is so iconic it has over 50 million views on YouTube. Despite clearly being created to profit off of internet addicted children, the creator of Two Sisters thirsts to tell a story within the bounds of the medium they have trapped themselves in.",

He stares at every text for so long it eventually becomes a 3D image of a horse that knows perfectly what it means to be human. While this video is simple in comparison to some of Big Joel’s other vids, I think this video is one of the finest representations of his work. In ‘Sinistar’ Big Joel looks at the Namco Museum classic Sinistar, and the unintended narrative it tells by misunderstanding the rules of the game. He talks about how media can have clear narratives often unintended by its creators, but despite the lack of intend these narratives are completely valid. Big Joel not only kills the author when it comes to analyzing text, he claims the author is perception itself. That’s kind of cool.",

Each song is a dissection of Kendrick Lamar’s torn soul. He analyzes his feelings and parses them into clear themes, characters and narratives. It’s the direct and honest pleas of a black man in America who considers himself lucky to have a platform. He feels guilty about his power though, and he feels obligated to use his voice to uplift those in his community. He has the weight of the world on his shoulders, and he’s collapsing. It’s an incredible display of storytelling, using characters, themes, repetition and atmosphere to give a perfect portrayal not of narrative, but of empathy.",

It bounces from smooth croony pop, to bass heavy chanting, to acoustic folk. Virtue is a mixtape. Lyrically the album is super upset. It’s pretentious and preachy, trying desperately to tell you to wake up. What is truth? Who can you really trust? What is real? It reads like a person losing their mind after losing trust in reality. Imagine if Metal Gear Solid 2 started a band. That’s the Voidz. This album wrote me a personal letter and it called me a normie for having a bank account. The sounds and lyrics of this album are entirely overwhelming, but I think that’s by design. In 20XX we’re constantly overwhelmed by information. What IS truth? Who CAN you really trust? What IS real? I honestly don’t know! The last song on the album, titled Pointlessness, features the lead-singer of the Voidz moaning “what does it matter” before assuring the audience no one is going to remember you anyways. It rules.",
